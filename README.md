# Azure Speech - Language Learning Assistant

## Overview
The aim of this project is to help people learn languages by checking their pronunciation or learning how to pronounce words, and also to translate what they are saying into different languages. To achieve this, it was used [Azure AI Foundry](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/ai-studio/) for __speech recognition__, __text-to-speech__, and __speech translation__. The available languages can be found [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/speech-service/language-support?utm_source=chatgpt.com&tabs=stt).

## Getting started
### Contents

- **SoundCorrect**: This will help you with your pronunciation by detecting what you have said.
- **SoundItOut**: If you are unsure how to pronounce something, you can check it here by typing it.
- **SoundTranslate**: If you want to know what you have said in another language, this will help you find out by translating it into the desired languages.
